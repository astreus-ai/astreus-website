title: Welcome to Astreus

**Astreus** is a powerful and flexible AI Agent Framework designed to help you easily build, deploy, and manage intelligent conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

## What is Astreus?

Astreus provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions to create AI agents that can:
- Hold complex, multi-turn conversations with **real-time streaming**
- Perform structured tasks and operations
- Reason over data from multiple sources
- Integrate with external systems through plugins
- Maintain memory of past interactions with **session management**
- **Access all components through a unified agent interface**

## Key Features

- **🤖 Agent-Centric Architecture**: Everything accessible through agent methods - no need for separate managers
- **⚡ Real-Time Streaming**: Built-in streaming chat with `agent.streamChat()` for live responses
- **🧠 Unified Memory Access**: Direct memory management with `agent.getHistory()`, `agent.addToMemory()`
- **💬 Session Management**: Automatic session tracking with `agent.listSessions()`
- **🔌 Integrated Plugin System**: Add tools with `agent.addTool()` and access via `agent.getAvailableTools()`
- **🗄️ Database Integration**: Direct database access through `agent.config.database`
- **🎯 Provider Flexibility**: Switch models with `agent.getProvider()` and `agent.getModel()`
- **📊 Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Ollama, and other LLM providers
- **🔍 RAG Support**: Built-in Retrieval Augmented Generation with automatic tool creation
- **🎨 Type Safety**: Fully typed with TypeScript for better development experience
- **📝 Advanced Logging**: Structured logging system for improved debugging and monitoring
- **⚙️ Flexible Configuration**: Enhanced parameter validation and smart defaults

## Agent-First Approach

With Astreus 0.1.9+, everything revolves around the **Agent**:

```typescript
// Create an agent with all capabilities
const agent = await createAgent({
  name: 'My Assistant',
  provider: myProvider,
  memory: myMemory,
  tools: [customTool1, customTool2]
});

// Stream responses in real-time
await agent.streamChat({
  message: "Hello!",
  sessionId: "chat-123",
  onChunk: (chunk) => console.log(chunk)
});

// Access everything through the agent
const sessions = await agent.listSessions();
const history = await agent.getHistory("chat-123");
const provider = agent.getProvider();
const memory = agent.config.memory;
```
